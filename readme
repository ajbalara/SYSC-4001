Assignment #1 - CPS program
Written by: Anand Balaram 101217776

This readme will explain how to use the CPS program.

This folder contains the source code files for the servers.

There are 2 server programs, ecg_server and image_server. These must be running in seperate terminals before the running the CPS. This is to emulate how in a real world application, the servers will be running before and independant of the local clinics launching their CPS program.

This folder contains a script called "launch_CPS", which when run will compile and run the CPS program.
